# MSD_Final_Project
This is a design for the simulation of the scheduler portion of a memory controller capable serving a 12-core 4.8 GHz processor employing a single 16GB PC5- 38400 DIMM. The system uses a relaxed consistency (XC) model. The controller uses the two channels of the DIMM independently.
